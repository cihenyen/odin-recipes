    <h1>spaghetti</h1>

        <h1>Description</h1>    
        <p>Noodles made of wheat and eggs were known in the Mediterranean world in antiquity, but the pasta we know as spaghetti—which takes its name from the Italian spaghetto, “little cord”—was probably introduced to Sicily by the island’s Arab conquerors in the 8th century. The name was first recorded in 1874, however, suggesting that spaghetti may have remained a regional dish until shortly after the unification of Italy. Spaghetti was likely eaten with butter and cheese until about that time too; although the tomato was introduced to Italy as part of the Columbian Exchange, it was not widely eaten until the 19th century.</p>
        <p>Made of durum wheat, or semolina, spaghetti is the most widely used of the “cord” pastas, which are cylindrical and solid. Related forms are spaghettini, which is a kind of particularly thin spaghetti, and vermicelli and angel hair pasta, which are thinner still. Spaghetti greatly outsells these other pastas. Italians eat about 24 kg (52 pounds) of dry pasta per capita annually, most in the form of spaghetti. Whereas Americans eat much less—about 9 kg (20 pounds) per capita per year—American consumption of carbohydrates is more problematic from a health standpoint, given that portion sizes are twice as large as those in Italy and that Italians are more inclined to walk than drive in the conduct of everyday life.</p>        </p>
