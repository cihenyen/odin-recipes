        <h1>Description</h1>    
        <p>Everyone should know how to cook rice. Most cuisines of the world are cooking rice in one way or another — from sushi to arroz con pollo, rice puddings to paella, and dolmas to dirty rice and jambalaya. We're also drinking our fair share of rice — in sake, horchata, rice milk, and even beer. All told, we humans get more than 20 percent of our calories from this small but mighty grain.</p>
        <p>There are many varieties of rice: white rice, brown rice, short-grain rice, long-grain rice; and different ways to cook rice: stovetop, rice cooker, multi-cooker (Instant Pot), microwave, and oven-baked.</p>
        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <u1>
            <li>2 cups of water</li>
            <li>pinch of salt</li>
            <li>1 cup of rice</li>
            <li>timer</li>
            <li>saucepan</li>
        </u1>
        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <o1>
         <li>Bring 2 cups of water to a boil in a small saucepan with a tight-fitting lid. You can add an optional pinch of salt if you wish. Add 1 cup of rice, stir briefly to break up clumps of rice, cover the pot with the lid, and reduce the heat to its lowest setting to help the rice cook evenly.</li>   
         <li>Set a timer for 20 minutes. A little steam will escape the covered pot while the rice cooks this is normal.</li>
         <li>When the timer rings, turn off the burner and remove the pan from the heat. Let the rice sit, covered, for an additional five minutes.</li>
         <li>After five minutes, remove the lid and fluff the rice with a fork to separate the grains.</li>
